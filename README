This folder contains a number of files to allow Parallel Computing Toolbox
to be used with SLURM via the generic cluster interface.

download and put these scripts in ~/matlab/ 

It's highly recommanded that you put

export TZ=America/Los_Angeles 

in your ~/.bashrc file, or you will see complains from Matlab.


* To start a matlab pool on a single(compute) node, use

cluster=get_LOCAL_cluster

before you can use parpool or batch to start the pool and use parfor or spmd. For a more detailed example, see example_local.m file.


* To start a matlab pool spanning multiple(compute) nodes through SLURM, use

cluster=get_SLURM_cluster('-t 10:00:00 --mem-per-cpu=2G') 

before you can use parpool or batch to start the pool and use parfor or spmd. Here "-t 10:00:00" is an example input for slurm sbatch options, you can put more options here, e.g. account request, memory request etc.

But don't put "-n" (number of tasks) here, "-n" option is requested throught the parpool or batch command. Read Matlab's documentation about parpool and batch for details.

The job's output and logs from Matlab will be stored in ~/MATLAB_JOB_STORAGE_local and ~/MATLAB_JOB_STORAGE, if you wish to change the locations, edit it in get_LOCAL_cluster.m and get_SLURM_cluster.m.
Matlab's terminal output can be captured by the diary cmd, for details, read Matlab's documentation.
