This folder contains a number of files to allow Parallel Computing Toolbox
to be used with SLURM via the generic cluster interface.

download and put these scripts in ~/matlab/ 

It's highly recommanded that you put

export TZ=America/Los_Angeles 

in your ~/.bashrc file.

* To start a matlab pool on a single(compute) node, use

cluster=get_LOCAL_cluster

for a more detailed example, see example_local.m file.


* To start a matlab pool spanning multiple(compute) nodes through SLURM, use


cluster=get_SLURM_cluster('-t 24:00:00') 


where "-t 24:00:00" is input for slurm sbatch options, you can put more options here, e.g. account request, memory request etc.
But don't put "-n" (number of tasks) here, "-n" option is requested throught the parpool command. 
For a more detailed example, see example_slurm.m file.
